# Mattcoin

A simple blockchain demo for a bit of fun  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## TODO

- Feature - implement better mining simulation (and 'fees' for transactions)
- Feature - implement wallet generation (with public key address and private key)
- Feature - implement decentralised nodes
- Feature - implement transaction confirmations
- Feature - implement block verification
- Bug - hash should be the key for blocks
